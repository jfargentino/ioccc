/* 
 * This is a fixed-increment version of Java 8's SplittableRandom generator
 * See http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2714064.2660195 and
 * http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/SplittableRandom.html
 * It is a very fast generator passing BigCrush, and it can be useful if
 * for some reason you absolutely want 64 bits of state; otherwise, we
 * rather suggest to use a xoroshiro128+ (for moderately parallel
 * computations) or xorshift1024* (for massively parallel computations)
 * generator.
 * The state can be seeded with any value.
