Version 1.03 released 20020103
is the same as version 1.02 except that the order of some declarations
in ranut.f has been changed for compatibility with f2c (as suggested
by Philip Leong).

Version 1.02 released 20011028
has improved comments, 
improved error messages,
some missing declarations added in test programs (tested with implicit none),
and fix in trannw.f (which gave erroneous error for mean 0).

Version 1.01 released 20011026-27
has tranut.txt, trannw.txt, tranut-low.out added,
new trannw.f (now similar to tranut.f),
some typos in comments in ranut.f, rannw.f corrected,
change in test data.
Omitted overlapping sums test as seems erroneous.
Fixed transformation to N(0,1) in testing 20011027.

Version 1.00 released 20011026 (and mailed to Philip Leong)
with ranut.f based on ranu4.f (with additional (r, s) pairs)
rannw.f based on rann4.f (with f increased to 4, changes in alpha, beta).
Omitted overlapping permutations test as seems to give erroneous results.
