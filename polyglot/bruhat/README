This incantation is submitted by apprentice Philippe 'BooK' Bruhat. He
can be summoned under the name of Philippe.Bruhat@francemel.com; he is
the maker of the thing. This wretched creature was spelled for the 4th
Circle of Judgement. However, when properly feeded, it could be judged
in the 1st Circle... Being too long a spell for that Circle, it can't.
